    <h1>  A Bit About Me  </h1>
    
    <p> My name's Karli Prather, and I was born and raised in western Kentucky. I originally lived in Hickory which is a small, rural town ten minutes from Mayfield and thirty minutes from Paducah. So, having grown up with a very rural background, why am I here? I am mainly interested in this class because I took a statistics course in high school that really inspired my interest in the field of data science. Before this class, I had never really learned any coding past a few projects I worked on in my free time as well as short, one to hour coding camps that my schools required us to take. I have never taken an actual, extended, formal class in computer science before. </p>
